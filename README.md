# Final-Project--QA-
Final Project

This project implements a wide range of the skills such as test analysis & design from the given requirements, writing tests for equivalence classes, making checklists for functionality & layout with preconditions, easy to follow steps, expected result and actual results, as well as web, mobile, and API testing, working in data bases through terminal, UI testing, JSON code, SQL/PostgreSQL. 
•The tools I used in this project include; DevTools, Charles, Postman, Android Studio, Cygwin 64 Terminal, and Jira for bug reports. 
•I was also tested in testing theory by writing detailed responses to questions about how testing is conducted, why certain techniques are used,I analyzed sample code with mistakes then rewrote the code correctly, as well as displaying my understanding of the app being tested by thoroughly breaking down all parts of both the layout and functionality into a clean and precise mind map.
